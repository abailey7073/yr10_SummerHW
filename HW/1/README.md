##Data Representation

###1 - Why do we represent data using binary when using computers *(1 mark)*

```
binary is the most effective way of representing data and is the standard way for computers to read this data.
```
###2 - How would we represent the number 147 in binary? *(1 mark)*
```
010010011
```
###3 - Can you convert the hexadecimal number **b5** to denary, there is a mark for you working. *(2 marks)*
```
Hexidecimal to Binary = 10110100
Binary to Denary = 11
```
###4 - Here is a function written is **pseudocode**.

FUNCTION validUser (users , user)
    FOR x <-1 to LEN(users)
        IF users[x] = user
			RETURN True
		ENDIF
	ENDFOR
	RETURN False
ENDFUNCTION
```

```
variable
```

(b) What type of data is returned by this function? **(1 mark)**
```

```

##Errors
###6 - This program is supposed to find the mean of a list of numbers and print it out for the user:

line1:		tot <- 0
line2:		nums <- [1,6,4,2,5,3]
line3:		FOR x <- to LEN(nums)
line4:			tot <- nums[x]
line5:		ENDFOR
line6:		mean <- tot
line7:		OUTPUT 	mean
```
